[INFO]:    The target file FASTA header formatting looks good!
[INFO]:    The target file contains at least one sequence for 396 unique genes.
[INFO]:    There are 21 sequences in your target file that contain a single stop codon in
           the last five amino-acids of the C-terminal end. These are:

           SWGX-5326, WWQZ-5326, UAXP-5339, BZDF-5421, SWGX-5578, NIJU-5594, UAXP-5594,

[WARNING]: There are 12 sequences in your target file that contain unexpected stop codons
           when translated in the first forwards frame. If your target file contains only
           protein-coding sequences, please check these sequences. Sequence names can be
           found in the sample log file (if running "hybpiper assemble") or printed below
           (if running "hybpiper check_targetfile").

[INFO]:    The target file final_sequences_set_TO_CHECK.FNA has been specified as
           containing DNA sequences. These DNA sequences will be checked for low-
           complexity regions. NOTE: the sequences flagged as having low-complexity
           regions can sometimes differ between a DNA target file and the corresponding
           translated protein target file. If you translate your target file to run
           "hybpiper assemble" with BLASTx/DIAMOND, we recommend re-checking the
           translated sequences for low-complexity regions.

[INFO]:    Minimum complexity threshold: 1.5
[WARNING]: The target file provided (final_sequences_set_TO_CHECK.FNA) contains sequences
           with low-complexity regions. The sequence names are printed below. These
           sequences can cause problems when running HybPiper, see
           https://github.com/mossmatters/HybPiper/wiki/Troubleshooting,-common-
           issues,-and-recommendations. We recommend one of the following approaches:

           1) Remove these sequence from your target file, ensuring that your file still
              contains other representative sequences for the corresponding genes.

           2) Start the run using the parameter "--timeout_assemble" (e.g.
              "--timeout_assemble 200"). See https://github.com/mossmatters/HybPiper/wiki/
              Full-pipeline-parameters#10-hybpiper-assemble for details.
