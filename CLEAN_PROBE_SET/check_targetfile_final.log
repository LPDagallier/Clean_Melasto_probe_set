[INFO]:    The target file FASTA header formatting looks good!
[INFO]:    The target file contains at least one sequence for 396 unique genes.
[INFO]:    The target file PROBE_SET_CLEAN_v4.FNA has been specified as containing DNA
           sequences. These DNA sequences will be checked for low-complexity regions.
           NOTE: the sequences flagged as having low-complexity regions can sometimes
           differ between a DNA target file and the corresponding translated protein
           target file. If you translate your target file to run "hybpiper assemble" with
           BLASTx/DIAMOND, we recommend re-checking the translated sequences for low-
           complexity regions.

[WARNING]: The target file provided (PROBE_SET_CLEAN_v4.FNA) contains sequences with low-
           complexity regions. The sequence names are printed below. These sequences can
           cause problems when running HybPiper, see
           https://github.com/mossmatters/HybPiper/wiki/Troubleshooting,-common-
           issues,-and-recommendations. We recommend one of the following approaches:

           1) Remove these sequence from your target file, ensuring that your file still
              contains other representative sequences for the corresponding genes.

           2) Start the run using the parameter "--timeout_assemble" (e.g.
              "--timeout_assemble 200"). See https://github.com/mossmatters/HybPiper/wiki/
              Full-pipeline-parameters#10-hybpiper-assemble for details.
