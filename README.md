Cleaning of the Melastomataceae probe set for target enrichment
================

<!-- README.md is generated from README.Rmd. Please edit that file -->

This repository details the cleaning process carried out for the
Melastomataceae probe set.

### Cleaning process

The cleaning process is detailed [here](Probe_set_cleaning_final.md).

### Clean probe set

The new and clean probe set is available here:
[`PROBE_SET_CLEAN.FNA`](CLEAN_PROBE_SET/PROBE_SET_CLEAN.FNA)
(nucleotides version) and
[`PROBE_SET_CLEAN_prot.FAA`](CLEAN_PROBE_SET/PROBE_SET_CLEAN_prot.FAA)
(amino acid version).

The purpose of this clean probe set is to be used **bioinformatically**
to recover targeted sequences from sequencing reads, but not to
physically target the sequences in vitro.
